# Release Doctor Validation Baseline

Before inviting pilot users, the scanner was run against five public upstream repositories. These are
preflight fixtures, not customer validation. The next milestone is five independent user-owned projects.

| Upstream fixture | Commit | Expected result | Observed result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `expo/expo-template-default` | `7537d91` | Expo Android + iOS; identifiers unresolved in the untouched template | Both platforms detected; unresolved identifier and Target API warnings |
| `react-native-community/template` | `ed3802b` | Native Android + iOS; Android Target API resolved | Both platforms detected; Android Target API passed; dynamic iOS identifier warned |
| `android/architecture-samples` | `ee66e15` | Android app; version-catalog Target API detected | Android detected; API 35 reported as below the 2026 submission minimum |
| `flutter/samples` `form_app` | `463e365` | Flutter Android + iOS; test targets excluded | Both platforms and release identifiers detected; Flutter-managed Target API warned as unresolved |
| `spring-guides/gs-gradle` | `878317c` | Non-mobile Gradle project | Rejected as no mobile project |

The core repository scan completed in under 100 ms per fixture on the validation machine. That excludes npx
installation time, which remains the largest first-run usability risk and is measured separately in the pilot.

This baseline checks platform classification and static policy evidence only. It does not test private source,
store credentials, uploaded builds, metadata, or review submission behavior.
